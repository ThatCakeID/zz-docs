# Contributing

Currently, you cannot really contribute, as most of the code is in private repositories, as the team has not yet talked about the way we will develop ZryteZene (with or without the code contributing community).

As for the documentation, if you feel something is missing you can always open a pull request, or an issue.

Open-Source repositories:

- [ThatCakeID/zz-android-old](https://github.com/ThatCakeID/zz-android-old) (Archive)
- [ThatCakeID/zzcli](https://github.com/ThatCakeID/zzcli) (Most likely an archive)
